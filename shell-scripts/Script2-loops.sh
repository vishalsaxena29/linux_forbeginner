#Lets take this to next level and start working on real things like loops

#lets start with small lets create a for loop in shell script which prints number from 0 to 10 
#Then we take this to something little big by printing odd,even,prime and then move to if then switch 
#and then combine all.


#1.print number 0 to 10 

for(( i=0 ; i<=10 ; i++ ))
do 
echo $i
echo ""
